## Introduction

YOLO-GSStarLite is an innovative and lightweight weed detection algorithm derived from YOLOv8n, designed to enhance detection accuracy and processing speed while minimizing false positives and negatives in complex agricultural settings. This repository contains the source code and resources related to the development and evaluation of YOLO-GSStarLite.

## Current Status

### Partial Code Release

We are pleased to announce the initial release of some components of the YOLO-GSStarLite project. The current version includes key modules that can be used to understand and experiment with the core functionality of our system. However, due to ongoing research and development efforts, not all parts of the codebase have been made public at this time.

**Note:** The remaining proprietary algorithms and data processing pipelines will be fully disclosed after the associated work has been published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we finalize these details.
